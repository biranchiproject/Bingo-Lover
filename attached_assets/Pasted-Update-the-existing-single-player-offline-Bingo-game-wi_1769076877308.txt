Update the existing single-player offline Bingo game with the following
VISUAL and UI enhancements only. Do not change game logic.

========================
NEON COLOR & GLOW EFFECTS
========================

1. Bingo Board Animation:
- The Bingo board must slowly and smoothly change neon colors over time.
- Color cycle example:
  Neon Yellow → Red → Electric Blue → Purple → Green
- Animation should be slow and eye-safe (around 15–25 seconds per cycle).

2. Neon Glow:
- The Bingo board must always have a neon glow matching the current board color.
- The board border color must sync with the board glow color.

3. Page Border Glow:
- Add a glowing border around the entire page.
- The page border color must always match the Bingo board’s current color.
- Add soft outer and inner glow to the page border.

4. Number Color Logic:
- Numbers inside the Bingo board must use an OPPOSITE / CONTRAST color
  compared to the current board color.
  Example:
  - If board is yellow → numbers cyan/blue
  - If board is red → numbers green
  - If board is blue → numbers yellow
- When a number is selected, it should glow using the board color.

5. Smooth Transitions:
- All color, glow, and border changes must transition smoothly.
- No flashing or harsh effects.
- Use CSS variables and keyframe animations for performance.

6. Background:
- Keep the background pure black.
- Do not add images.
- Focus on neon glow and premium arcade feel.

========================
